    "## 3.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Back-propagation: sending information through Graphs\n",
    "In order to efficiently compute the gradient on large neural networks, all neural network frameworks construct what is referred to as a **Graph**. This Graph retains the order of operation applied to every input by storing the intermediate values and operations performed at every step. This way when the output error is computed, it can be propagated backwards through the Graph. Applying Gradient Descent with those computed gradients will nudge the weights in a better state. An example is given below\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bp1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In vectorial form:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bp1a.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also augment the number of outputs:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bp2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "And write that in vectorial form:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bp2a.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Every operation in a Neural Network can be approximated by a group of nodes that take either 1 or 2 inputs and produce 1 output. Thanks to the chain rule, every node in this graph can be looked at independantly. Thus to compute the gradient of the inputs, all that is needed is the gradient of the output, the value of the inputs and the inverse of the applied function. Thanks to this *divide and conquer approach*, a large and complex system, like a deep neural network, is split up in small manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tensors\n",
    "In the mathematical sense a Tensor is a multi-dimensional array. Some special cases are the vector (1D) and matrix (2D). In Deep Learning this term refers to a data-array whose dimensions will depend on the situation (due to the varying batch-sizes). During this practical session we'll focus on the 'simpler' Fully Connected layers, thus only 1D and 2D Tensors will be used. In a few weeks we'll expand this to 4D Tensors in order to support Convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auto-grad systems\n",
    "There are 2 ways to code Back-Propagation. You could for every possible operation in a Neural Network define a module and compute the gradients by hand for every operation:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class TestModule():\n",
    "    def __init__(self, param1, param2):\n",
    "        self.param1 = param1\n",
    "        self.param2 = param2\n",
    "        self.weights = <matrix>(param1, param2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def forward(self, x1, x2):\n",
    "        self.x1 = x1\n",
    "        self.x2 = x2\n",
    "        # f computes a function\n",
    "        return f(self.weights, x1, x2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def backwards(self):\n",
    "        # df computes the gradients for weights, x1 and x2 based on \n",
    "        # the partial derivative of f\n",
    "        return df(self.weights, self.x1, self.x2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "While there is nothing wrong with this approach it isn't really that handy to use since every module will need it's own forward and backward steps. Wouldn't it be great if we could do something like this\n",
    "```\n",
    "x1 = GradTensor(<data1>)\n",
    "x2 = GradTensor(<data2>)\n",
    "y = x1+x2\n",
    "z = (y*x1)+5\n",
    "```\n",
    "and have the gradients be computed automatically along the way? \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 First objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The point today will be to implement a somewhat simplified **autograd system** from scratch. Such a system constructs a Graph and automatically computes the gradients based on this structure. Thus during the forward pass *dependencies* are created in order to remember the data-flow and *gradients in the form of lambda-functions* are saved. This is done because **the gradient at the start of the network can only be computed once every subsequent gradient already has been computed**!\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide you the main structure and ask you to fill in the following functions:\n",
    "* `gt_add`: Matrix addition (this one will be done by the assistant as an example)\n",
    "* `gt_mul`: Elementwise matrix multiplication\n",
    "* `gt_matmul`: Matrix multiplication \n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases you may suppose that the matrices have the *correct dimension*. Thus if you encounter a dimension problem, *your* code is at fault. To test your implementation execute the cell below, if no errors occur you can move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dont worry about the following 2 functions `GradTensor._add_batch_dim` and `gt_type_check`. Those functions are there to avoid errors caused by `numpy` [broadcasting](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/theory.broadcasting.html)."
